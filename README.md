# Spotify Playlist Randomizer

 I got tired of dealing with spotify's baseline shuffle function, so I wrote up a very simple piece of code to shuffle a text file of spotify song links.

 I also implemented a PHP webhosted version that will interact with the Spotify API to directly modify a playlist, as well as create a backup of the playlist.
